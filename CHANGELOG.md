## [Unreleased]

### Added

- EUPL v1.2 license file
- `.editorconfig` for consistent code formatting

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-31

Initial release of ztick, a time-based job scheduler written in Zig with
hexagonal architecture.

### Added

- **Core scheduler** with three-thread architecture (controller, database,
  processor) and bounded FIFO channels for inter-thread communication
- **TCP protocol** — line-based text protocol on `127.0.0.1:5678` with
  request/response routing and quoted string support
  - `SET` — schedule a job at a given timestamp
  - `GET` — retrieve a single job by ID
  - `QUERY` — prefix-based job lookup with multi-line response
  - `REMOVE` — delete a job by ID
  - `RULE SET` — create a recurring rule with runner type
  - `REMOVERULE` — delete a rule by ID
  - `LISTRULES` — list all configured rules
- **Persistence** — append-only logfile with 4-byte length-prefixed binary
  framing, supporting jobs, rules, and removal entries
- **In-memory persistence backend** — alternative to logfile for ephemeral
  workloads, selectable via `persistence = "memory"` in config
- **Background compression** — scheduled deduplication of logfile entries with
  atomic rename, clock regression guard, and configurable interval
- **Shell runner** — execute shell commands on job trigger
- **TLS encryption** — optional TLS 1.3 via system OpenSSL with `tls_cert` and
  `tls_key` configuration (ADR-0003)
- **Logfile dump command** — offline inspection with text, JSON, and compact
  output modes, plus follow (tail) mode with signal handling
- **Startup logging** — configurable log levels (off, error, warn, info, debug,
  trace) with data restoration and connection lifecycle logging
- **OpenTelemetry instrumentation** — distributed tracing and metrics via
  OTLP/HTTP using zig-o11y/opentelemetry-sdk (ADR-0004)
  - `ztick.request` spans with server span kind, command type, request ID, and
    success attributes
  - `service.name` and `service.version` resource attributes via custom
    `ResourceAwareOTLPExporter`
- **Configuration** — custom TOML parser with sections for `[log]`,
  `[controller]`, `[database]`, and `[telemetry]`
- **Hexagonal architecture** — four strict layers (domain, application,
  infrastructure, interfaces) with barrel exports
- **Comprehensive documentation** — ADRs, user guides, reference docs, tutorials,
  and example configurations
- **Functional test suite** — integration tests covering all protocol commands,
  persistence backends, TLS, dump modes, compression, and telemetry
